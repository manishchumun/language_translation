# Language Translation using a Recurrent Neural Network

This is my project submission for the Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree from Udacity.

In this project, I use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to train a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.

You can view my work and the model accuracy directly downloading and opening the html file.

The data on which the model was trained is also available in the repo.

I use floyd to train the model. More on floyd at https://www.floydhub.com. But you can use AWS or other environments with GPUs to train the model.
